  </div></br></br></br></br></br><h1><p>Congratulations to the department of ECE for the new volume of spiral spectrum.
     I am very sure this fulfils its role as a dynamic platform for teachers and students ,where they  get to showcase their inherent talents and 
     enhance their  technical knowledge and literary thinking which is helping students in overall development. I appreciate department formotivating 
     students to learn, grow, explore and think, and my heartfelt appreciations to the editorial board for  successfully envisioning and creating this magazine.
      It commendably upholds  the spirit of learning coupled with a drive for original thinking. </p>
  </br>
    <p>I wish all the success to my dear students and department of ECE for all its future endeavours.</p>
