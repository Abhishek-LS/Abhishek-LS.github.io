      <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  over the year,I gained the knowledge of HTML,CSS & Javascript. So this project is to put all that into
         action and learned more about Webdevelopment.I mainly concentrated on the frontend and 10% of work is done at backend which can be seen 
         in quiz part.Since this my first mini Project,I hope you will pardon me for 
         for my mistake.</p>
         <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; By doing this as per myself, I learned lot of things and also experienced the hardship one has to go
            through when the things doesn't go as planned.But at last I'm happy about my work and I hope this page gives 
         some information you are looking. </p>
