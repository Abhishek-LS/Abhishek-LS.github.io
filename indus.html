      <h1>Industrial revolution 5 . 0 â€” 'Where Mind Meets Machine' </h1>

      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as revolutions go, the one we are living through now seems quiet. during these days
        of Covid-19, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is enabled by technologies that are based on computing and the internet, which largely do their work in the 
        background of our lives. Main applications include the Internet of Things ("smart"
      toasters and refrigerators), artificial Intelligence autonomous vehicles and medicine tailored to an individual's DNA.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It's difficult to imagine a world without the Fourth Industrial Revolution's technologies. Yet, as surely as four follows three and five follows four, 
        there will be further industrial revolutions. starting from industrial  revolution 1.0 in 1780, now we are in  industrial revolution 5.0, the technology has  
        improved vastly these years.

      <br> <br><br> <br><p>The Fifth Industrial Revolution will make
 
        that connection closer and seamless, and will feel unmediated. The smart device onto which we tap and into which we  speak will disappear. Brain-computer interfaces will replace them. The fifth will stand on the shoulders of the fourth, as technology of diminishing size will be fundamental, and the digital networks will be essential.
       <h2> ONE MAJOR EXAMPLE THAT
        INDUSTRIAL 	REVOLUTION 	5.0,
        AIMING IS DRIVER-LESS CAR </h2>
       <p></p> The idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if it's about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. Developers of self-driving cars use vast amounts of data from image recognition systems, along with machine-learning and neural networks, to build systems that can drive autonomously. The neural networks identify patterns in the data, which is fed to the machine learning algorithms. That data includes images from cameras on self-driving cars from which the neural network learns to identify traffic lights, trees, curbs, pedestrians, street signs and other parts of any given driving environment. For example, Google's selfdriving car project, called Waymo, uses a mix of sensors, Iidar (light detection and ranging a technology similar to RADAR) and cameras and combines all of the data those systems generate to identify everything around the vehicle and predict what those objects might do next.	This happens	in fractions of a second. Maturity is important for these	systems. The more the system drives, the more data it can incorporate into its deep learning algorithms, enabling it to make more enhanced driving choices.

      <h3>The following outlines how Google Waymo vehicles work:</h3><p>
        The driver (or passenger)	sets a
        destination. The car's software calculates a route. A rotating, roof-mounted Lidar
        sensor monitors a 60-meter range around the car and creates a dynamic threedimensional (3D) map of the car's current environment.
         A sensor on the left rear wheel monitors sideways movement to detect the car's position relative to the 3D map. Radar systems in the front and rear bumpers
          calculate distances to obstacles.AI software in the car is connected to all the sensors and collects input from Google Street View and video cameras inside the car. 
          The Al simulates human perceptual and decision-making processes using deep learning and controls actions in driver control systems, such as steering and brakes. The car'S software consults Google Maps for advance notice of things like landmarks, traffic signs and lights. An override function is available to enable a human to take control of the vehicle. Hands-free steering centres the car without the driver's hands on the wheel. The driver is still required to pay attention. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) down to a stop automatically maintains a selectable distance between the driver's car and the car in front.
