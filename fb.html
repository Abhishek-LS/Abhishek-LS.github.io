      <h1>FELIX BAUMGARTNER: THE MAN WHO PIERCED THE SKY </h1>

      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personality you are seeing here is Felix Baumgatner,	an Austrian	skydiver daredevil and base jumper. He was born on 20	April	1969. Baumgartner	is renowned 	for 	the particularly dangerous nature of the stunts he has performed during his career. He spent time in the Austrian military where he practiced parachute jumping, including training to land on small target zones. He is best known for jumping to earth a helium balloon from the stratosphere on 14 october 2012 and landing in New Mexico, United states as part of the Red bull stratos project. Doing so, he set world records for skydiving an estimated 39km, reaching an estimated top of 1357.64km/h.</p>
       <p> He became the 1 st person to break the sound barrier relative to the surface without vehicular power on his descent. He broke skydiving records for exit altitude, vertical freefall distance without a drogue parachute, and vertical speed without a drogue. Though
        he still holds two records, the 1 st
        was broken 2 years later, when on 24 October
        2014, "Alan Eustace" jumped from 41.42km with a drogue
        </p>
        
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 14, last year, the Austrian parachutist Felix Baumgartner sat in a pressurized capsule at nearly 128,000 feet, floating over the wastelands of eastern New Mexico, preparing to jump out. A fragile helium balloon suspended him there in ultrathin air, higher than jets can fly. For more than three hours he had been breathing pure oxygen to purge his blood of nitrogen against decompression sickness, or "the bends". Like astronauts or the pilots of high-altitude reconnaissance airplanes, he wore a full pressure suit with the helmet visor down. For now, the suit was deflated, allowing for relatively easy movement, but Baumgartner  disliked it. The suit stank of rubber, and when inflated it hemmed him in. Baumgartner had never liked to be hemmed in.
         On his forearm he had a tattoo in Gothic lettering that proclaimed, born to fly.
       </p>
       <p>His goal now was to break the altitude record for a human free fall, and in the process also to exceed the speed of sound. Baumgartner was not there to advance mankind. That was for others to claim, if they liked. He was a showman for the Red Bull company, which had plowed a fortune into this endeavour in order to associate its energy drink with his feats. Baumgartner, who was 43 at the time, is certainly a manly man. He is photogenic. He is fit. When he furrows his brow, he looks determined and intense.</p>
       <p> Indeed, the horizon line there was to the naked eye very nearly flat, and at 128,000 feet Baumgartner was fully 200,000 feet lower than the generally agreed upon threshold to space. He was, however, at an extremely high altitude —99,000 feet higher than Mount Everest, and higher than anyone had ever flown except in spaceships and rocket planes. Beneath him, North America stretched for hundreds of miles in shades of brown and swirls of cloud; above him, the sky had turned a deep blue black. Outside the
        protective walls of his capsule, the atmospheric pressure was so low—a fraction of 1 percent of the pressure at sea level—that the briefest direct exposure to
        it would have been fatal. And yet he was going to inflate the pressure suit, fully depressurize the capsule, allow the door
        to roll open, step outside into the bright light of altitude, and hop into the void. Seconds later, if all went well, he was going to break the speed of sound.
        </p>
        <p>For five years a group of veteran aerospace engineers and test pilots had coalesced around this project. One of those people was the American fighter pilot and research balloonist Joseph Kittinger, whose 1960 free-fall record  (Mach 0.91 from 102,800 feet) Baumgartner was proposing to break.  </p>
        <p>Now 84, Kittinger was rotund. He was currently controlling the balloon from the ground and serving as the main communicator on the radio link to  Baumgartner in flight. Forty - three miles to the west, at the Roswell, New Mexico, airport, in a pre-fabricated building that housed the project's Mission Control  some of the principal engineers were worried about Baumgartner's state of mind. However, much they liked him personally and enjoyed his company over beers, they had found him to be difficult to work with—stubborn, selfdramatizing, smart yet intellectually insecure, strangely disengaged from the science behind the project, and emotionally unpredictable. He was certainly not the cool, well-educated test-pilot type they normally dealt with.  </p>
        <p>The launch was flawless: The balloon drifted eastward, climbing a thousand feet a minute.  At his station on the ground Kittinger had flight instrumentation and controls that allowed him to vent helium if the balloon climbed too fast, to drop ballast if it did not  climb fast enough, and, at the extreme, to cut away the capsule and bring it down safely on  its large, cargo-style parachute. Baumgartner had the same capabilities from inside the capsule and was trained to complete the flight autonomously should contact with Kittinger be lost, but meanwhile, quite reasonably, he had opted to leave the flying to the master. Within the constraints of his profession Baumgartner's guiding principle has always been to minimize physical risk. He had covered the clear acrylic door in front of him with a sun shield taped with checklists, so his view outside was limited at best. Above his face was a bank of lights controlled by a camera crew on the ground to illuminate the interior, which otherwise would
          have been lit only by two small portholes on the sides. Radio communications and video images were streamed to the public after a 20-second delay, to allow for sanitizing if necessary. In the event of some grave embarrassment, or of a full-fledged catastrophe, the world would not hear and see it in real time, or perhaps ever.
          </p>
          <p>Then, suddenly, after about an hour, as the balloon climbed through 68,000 feet, Baumgartner radioed, "Joe, I've got a problem with my faceplate." Kittinger responded with a coded message to his team to cut the public audio feed. The crisis
            proceeded in private. Faceplate is another name for a helmet visor. Baumgartner's was electrically heated to keep it from fogging up—a condition of limited visibility that would preclude any high-altitude jump. Because he now noticed some fogging when he exhaled, Baumgartner believed that the heating
            system had failed.
            </p>
            <p>The project chief—a tall, gaunt Californian named Arthur Thompson— did some troubleshooting and concluded that the system was working fine. He reminded Baumgartner that, in any case, the visor  would switch automatically to a hardwired single setting of "High" when he unplugged the umbilical cord that connected the suit to the capsule's power, and began to rely solely on the batteries in his chest pack. The batteries  would deliver 20 minutes
               of undiminished visor heating—plenty of time for Baumgartner to leave the capsule and fall to  an altitude of 10,000 feet, where he was expected to deploy his parachute and open the visor in preparation for landing. The logic was solid, but Baumgartner would have none  of it. He continued to express concerns about  the visor. At Mission Control, the engineers  began to express concerns about  Baumgartner.</p>
