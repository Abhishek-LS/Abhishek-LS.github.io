      <h2>Short Story </h2>
      <h1>THE SCIENTIFIC SAINT</h1>
      <p>An ordinary looking fisherman's boy of a small village in South India, inspired by his noble parents always had the intent of working hard. As a young boy, sold newspapers to help his parents for living. He had nothing but his dreams to fulfil.
         The journey of him from Pamban Island to New Delhi is inspiring to many.</p>
        <h2><u>Role of a teacher</u></h2>
        <h2>"The teacher awakes joy in creative expression
          and knowledge in children"
          </h2>
         <p> When the boy was studying in fifth grade, a lesson from his teacher Siva Subramanian lyer, had a lasting impression on him. The teacher took students to the beach to demonstrate how birds fly. The assignment was just to observe seagulls
           fly, with their aerial aerobatics over the waves which later inspired the boy to take up a career in aeronautics.
      </p>
      <h2> "For a bird to fly it should first open its wings." </h2>
      <p>Subramanian lyer drew a diagram of a bird on the black board, showing wings, tail, body and  head, to teach about bird's flight. He explained at length 
        about the lifting force and how they change direction while flying by tilting their wings to different angles.</p>
      <p>Later teacher asked whether they understood how birds fly, boy stood up and confessed frankly that he did not. 
        All his classmates said they did not understand, either. But lyer's lesson did not merely impart an understanding of how bird flies. That day, teacher made young minds to realize that a bird is powered by its own life force and the motivation to fly- it's will.</p>
       <p>This curious boy with ignited scientific temperament grew up to become India's top missile scientist and finally the president of the nation - " APJ Abdul Kalam"</p>
        <h2><u>Failures in life:-</u><h2></h2>
       <p> In the game of life, failures play an important  role in shaping the success. Failures are inevitable in life, one who has self and resilience will overcome it and enjoy the fruits of success. It becomes meaningless if any success is achieved without failures and sufferings of it. Failing in a work, in any way is the process of making the work perfect.
        </p>
        <p>Today's children and youth fear failures, which is making them settle for less and they are unable to realise their potential. It is duty of the parents and teachers to teach a child
          how to handle failures. So, that they are in the way of achieving the impossible.
          </p>
          <h2>"Failure will not overtake me if my definition to succeed is strong enough"</h2>
          <p>As Kalam was fascinated by the flight of birds, he did his degree in aeronautical engineering. And dreamt of joining the Indian Air Force. When he was 26 years old, graduated from MIT, Air Force (DID&P), Ministry of Defence had called him for an interview which was to be held at Air Force Selection Board (IAFSB) located at Dehradun, Uttarakhand.</p>
          <p>The day came, with all his heart and soul, he attended the interview. He easily managed to clear Stage 1 test (IQ test) and
            several other examinations conducted on the first day. Twenty- five candidates were selected for the stage — Il testing, which
            consisted of psychological test and group tests spread over five days. Kalam passed all of them. Finally, he was interviewed on the last day, along with fellow hopefuls. Unfortunately, he finished ninth in the batch of twenty — five examined through stage- Il, to select eight officers. Kalam was deeply disappointed and shocked by the result.</p>
            <h3>"We are all playing the ultimate game of life, regardless of whether we want to or not.  Those who play the game well will win in life, while those who play it poorly suffer. And those who do not know they are playing the game are subject to cruellest of fates"</h3>
            <p>It took Kalam some time to comprehend that the opportunity to join the Air force had just slipped away. Nevertheless, he did not lose hope, he accepted that he was not destined to become an air force pilot. And the failure was just a step towards his success. Later on, he went to become most loved President of  India. From desiring to become an air force pilot to supreme commander of the armed forces, his journey is truly inspiring. </p>
